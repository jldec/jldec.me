# Publishing on the Web should be like...

### today (best case)

1. go to your domain, click new or edit
2. type your thoughts
3. publish

No dev server, no git workflow, no build.  
Yes history, yes images, yes private, yes instant.

### tomorrow

#### content consumers
- expect more personalized delivery
- they are in charge.
- click on a tweet
- find out whats happening
- go as deep as you want without touching sides

#### publishers
- will have to adapt how and what and where they publish
- think about SEO in a post-google era
- now think about the long tail of small business and personal domain names...

#### developers
- a new era means new opportunities
- expect new platforms and new frameworks

#### designers
- expect more changes in how people consume content
